<h1>Obsidian doesn&#39;t click for me</h1>
<p class="muted">2023.10.12</p>
<article><p>The idea of a personal wiki has always appealed to me. I tried a few times to incorporate one into my &quot;workflow&quot; if I even have one. I tried all sorts of different tools but the latest one that's been keeping me occupied is <a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. I really want to like and use Obsidian, but I'm unable to. Let me explain.</p>
<p>I've implemented the <a href="https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/">PARA method</a> into my personal wiki. It's a way of organizing all information into four buckets:</p>
<ul>
<li>Projects for any ongoing stuff</li>
<li>Areas for anything that's going on in your life like your car, finances, mental health, etc.</li>
<li>Resources for anything that you might want to reference later</li>
<li>Archives for anything that's no longer relevant</li>
</ul>
<p>Gotta say, I love this so much and it's not really relevant to any one tool. I've been using this method for a while now and it's been working great.</p>
<p>But, even with this organisation of information going on, Obsidian still doesn't click for me.</p>
<p>To be frank, Obsidian just... feels wrong. It's undeniably an Electron app and that just makes the experience really cumbersome to me. The application always feels a little sluggish and is never truly at home on any platform. You can make Obsidian look a little better using the great <a href="https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal">Minimal theme</a> but its core problems remain. The entire ecosystem of themes and plugins is also a little overwhelming and are prone to break in any subsequent release. I don't want to spend hours tweaking my personal wiki, I just want to use it. The barrier between my thoughts and putting them into writing needs to be as low as possible.</p>
<p>I know there are many people out there who love Obsidian, people who spend dozens of hours making it just right. I however will be reluctantly looking elsewhere.</p>
