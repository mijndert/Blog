<h1>OpenBSD</h1>

<article><p>I've been an avid user of various Linux distributions for 22+ years now and I will forever love everything about it and what it brought me. I have my entire carreer built on Linux and open source software. I've also known about BSD for about as long, but I never quite got into it, until now. I'm as much a minimalist as I am a nerd and I love simple software that does one thing well. I want all of my software to Just Work, no hassle or needless features added. After coming across <a href="https://openbsd.amsterdam/">OpenBSD.ams</a> I decided to read up on OpenBSD and its <a href="https://www.openbsd.org/goals.html">goals</a>.</p>
<p>Long story short, I'm currently in the process of moving some workloads from Linux VM's to OpenBSD ones. It's been quite a journey so far because unlearning 22 years of Linux experience is... hard. Luckily the community is awesome and the available documentation even more so. But what makes OpenBSD such a joy to use are the sane defaults and the completely empty config files that are just there for me to fill out as I see fit. It feels like the system was designed to fit whatever purpose I have in mind without ever getting in the way. Stuff like <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/httpd.8">httpd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/relayd.8">relayd(8)</a>, <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/acme-client.1">acme-client(1)</a> and <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/pf.4">pf(4)</a> make the entire system feel very robust and well thought out.</p>
<p>Over in the Linux world everything just seems to be strung together with little sense of direction. It always felt like a pile of software that happens to sometimes work together. OpenBSD is the opposite of that and I love it. I just wish I could run it on my laptop as well, with all the bells and whistles working. But that's a bit of a pipe dream as bluetooth support is currently completely missing.</p>
<p>For now it's a great operating system for servers for me. If you also want to play around with OpenBSD and indirectly <a href="https://www.openbsdfoundation.org/">support the foundation</a> I would highly recommend getting a VM over at <a href="https://openbsd.amsterdam/">OpenBSD.ams</a>.</p>
