<h1>Walking on sand for 11 hours</h1>
<p class="muted">2024.08.05</p>
<article><p>I love running, a lot. So much in fact, that not running feels weird. But this post isn't entirely about running, it's about walking as well. Walking on sand to be more specific. But maybe it's best I rewind a bit before we get to that topic.</p>
<p>Back in October of last year my wife got diagnosed with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sclerosis">Multiple Sclerosis</a> (MS). MS is a chronic disease of the central nervous system and is very unpredicable. My wife has been severly impacted by the disease already; it's basically all up in her brain and her spine already. She went from being a healthy, active, energetic woman, to being in a wheelchair when she was released from the hospital after a full week. It's been a really rough ride for us all. She's now slowly recovering from her big flare-up; she can walk outside for 20 minutes a few times a week, but there's really rough days as well where she can't do much at all.</p>
<p>Why am I writing this here and how does it tie into running? Let me explain.</p>
<p>There's basically only two things I'm quite good at: computer stuff and running. Luckily there's a <a href="https://www.msmotion.nl/fundraisers/mijndert-stuij">fundraiser for MS research</a> where people can either walk or run. I signed up for the 10k running activity and so far I've raised just shy of â‚¬3000 which blows my mind. I'm so grateful for all of the support I have received from friends, family, colleagues and even strangers.</p>
<p>Because my wife isn't in a good place health-wise, I feel even more motivated to be the best and healthiest version of myself so I signed up for a <a href="https://bredasesingelloop.nl/">5k in the city of Breda</a> just for fun. It's a beautiful city, some of my friends take part in the 5k as well, and it's a great way to get some extra kilometers in.</p>
<p>I've always been fascinated with what I can achieve when I really put my mind to it. Back in the day I ran 10k's and half marathon distances without much issue. Of course now I'm a bit older so it doesn't come easy anymore. But I'm still fascinated by the idea of pushing my limits and seeing how far I can go. I never really went beyond the 21.1km mark, so I'm curious to see what I can do. Together with a friend I signed up for a <a href="https://www.11strandentocht.nl/">50km walk across 11 beaches</a> in the Netherlands. It's going to be a long, cold, grueling day but I've seldom been more excited to get started. November 2nd we'll wake up at 3AM to get to the starting point and walk all the way to Zandvoort.</p>
<p>Next year my goal is to get back to running half marathon distances with a goal time of 2 hours 15 minutes or less. I know, with a little more effort, I can do it again.</p>
