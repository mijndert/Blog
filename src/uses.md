## Hardware

- **13" MacBook Air** (2020, M1, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) – This is the cheapest laptop Apple sells (I got mine for €900,-), but by no means is it slow. I use this thing as my couch computer and is more than capable of running all the software I need.
- **HP Z38C** – I got this monitor for free from someone who wasn't using it. It's a great monitor, but I'm not sure I would have bought it myself. It's a bit on the expensive side, but now that I have an ultrawide, I never want to go back.
- **iPhone 13 Pro** (256GB, Space Grey) – I bought the 13 when the 14 was released to save some money. It's a great phone, even for the money, the best feature is the camera which produces stunning images in every situation which is a huge plus when you have kids.
- **Logitech MX Ergo** – Due to RSI issues, I can't use a 'normal' pointing device anymore. Luckily Logitech still makes trackballs and this latest one with a rechargeable battery is a great addition to my desk.
- **Magic Keyboard** – Keyboard nerds will winch at this, but I think the Magic Keyboard is the best keyboard ever. I like keyboards with low travel and this one is perfect in every single way for me.
- **AirPods Max** (Space Grey) – I use these every single day for hours on end for listening to music and taking meetings. They're the best headphones I've ever had.
- **Sonos One** – I use this speaker for some background noise while working. It's been rock solid over the years and I bet I can get another few years out of it without any issues whatsoever.
- **Kobo Aura h2O Edition 2** – The older I get, the more I gravitate towards devices that do one thing well, preferable with almost endless battery life. An e-reader is a great example of that. 
- **Garmin Forerunner 255S** – I don't technically use this item for work either, but I have to include it because it keeps me sane as a running companion. I recently bought the 255S even though the 265S was out as well, again to save some money. This model has 99% of the features, and I only paid €280,- for it.

## Software

- **Apple Notes, Calendar, Mail** – The defaults are good enough for almost everyone.
- **Firefox** – I use Firefox as my main browser. I like the focus on privacy compared to other offerings, and I refuse to use Chromium-based browsers. 
- **Alacritty** – Together with tmux, this is just a great terminal emulator with a portable config file.
- **Visual Studio Code** – A good, extensible editor that I use for all my coding needs.
- **[NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/)** – My RSS reader of choice. It's a native Mac app that syncs beautifully with its iOS counterpart.
- **1Password** – I've been a customer for years and I'm very happy with the service.
- **Things** – Not sure I use all the features, but I love the design so I happily sponsor the company.
- **[Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com)** – A great tiling window manager for macOS. Keeps my windows arranged nicely. Code editor to the left, terminal to the right, all evenly spaced.
- **[Scroll Reverser](https://pilotmoon.com/scrollreverser/)** – Makes switching between trackpad (natural scrolling) and trackball (non-natural scrolling) a breeze.
- **[Reflex](https://stuntsoftware.com/reflex/)** - macOS sometimes hijacks the media buttons, this little app prevents that.
- **[K9S](https://k9scli.io/)** – A great terminal-based UI for Kubernetes.
- **[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/)** – I use Terraform to manage all my cloud infrastructure.
