summary: How I use AI in my daily life, as responsibly as possible.

Every word on this site, and my others sites, was written by me, a human being. None of the images were generated with AI.

I use GitHub Copilot in my code editor, Visual Studio Code, to help me write code faster. I use it mainly for autofilling certain variables in my Terraform code. I sometimes ask it to sort a list in alphabetical order. I try to avoid using it for anything more complex than that.

I actively block bots used for training LLMs and will continue to do so as best I can. I consider it unethical at best to do what the AI companies are doing: scraping the open web first then asking if we want to opt out.

I won't send you emails or messages generated by AI. Likewise if you send me what is obviously an AI generated message, I won't read it. It shows a lack of respect for my time. If you couldn't be bothered to write it, I won't be bothered to read it.
