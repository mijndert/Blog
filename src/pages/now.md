- [Fundraising](https://www.msmotion.nl/fundraisers/mijndert-stuij) for MS research to help patients now and in the future
- Learning to default to [optimism](https://stephango.com/optimism)
- Planning to hopefully write week notes and stick to it for an entire year, starting January 2025
- Trying to use my Sony RX100 a little more again. Photograpy has always been a hobby.
