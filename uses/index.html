<h1>Uses</h1>

<article><h2>Hardware</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>13&quot; MacBook Air</strong> (2020, M1, 8GB RAM, 256GB SSD) – This is the cheapest laptop Apple sells (I got mine for €900,-), but by no means is it slow. I use this thing as my couch computer and is more than capable of running all the software I need.</li>
<li><strong>HP Z38C</strong> – I got this monitor for free from someone who wasn't using it. It's a great monitor, but I'm not sure I would have bought it myself. It's a bit on the expensive side, but now that I have an ultrawide, I never want to go back.</li>
<li><strong>iPhone 13 Pro</strong> (256GB, Space Grey) – I bought the 13 when the 14 was released to save some money. It's a great phone, even for the money, the best feature is the camera which produces stunning images in every situation which is a huge plus when you have kids.</li>
<li><strong>Logitech MX Ergo</strong> – Due to RSI issues, I can't use a 'normal' pointing device anymore. Luckily Logitech still makes trackballs and this latest one with a rechargeable battery is a great addition to my desk.</li>
<li><strong>Magic Keyboard</strong> – Keyboard nerds will winch at this, but I think the Magic Keyboard is the best keyboard ever. I like keyboards with low travel and this one is perfect in every single way for me.</li>
<li><strong>AirPods Max</strong> (Space Grey) – I use these every single day for hours on end for listening to music and taking meetings. They're the best headphones I've ever had.</li>
<li><strong>Sonos One</strong> – I use this speaker for some background noise while working. It's been rock solid over the years and I bet I can get another few years out of it without any issues whatsoever.</li>
<li><strong>Kobo Aura h2O Edition 2</strong> – The older I get, the more I gravitate towards devices that do one thing well, preferable with almost endless battery life. An e-reader is a great example of that.</li>
<li><strong>Garmin Forerunner 255S</strong> – I don't technically use this item for work either, but I have to include it because it keeps me sane as a running companion. I recently bought the 255S even though the 265S was out as well, again to save some money. This model has 99% of the features, and I only paid €280,- for it.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Software</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Apple Notes, Calendar, Mail, Reminders</strong> – The defaults are good enough for almost everyone.</li>
<li><strong>Safari</strong> - Again, defaults are great. Safari has Tab Groups which I use quite extensively.</li>
<li><strong>VS Code</strong> – Simply the best code editor with all of its plugins.</li>
<li><strong>Things</strong> – For any project that's a little too complex or gets out of hand for Apple Reminders.</li>
<li><strong>Alacritty + Tmux</strong> – Pretty awesome, fast terminal emulator paired with Tmux for split panes and windows.</li>
<li><strong>Obsidian</strong> - My second brain. Even though I struggle to use it from time to time, so I'm always looking for a replacement.</li>
<li><strong>NetNewsWire</strong> – My RSS reader of choice. It's a native Mac app that syncs beautifully with its iOS counterpart.</li>
<li><strong>1Password</strong> – I've been a customer for years and I'm very happy with the service.</li>
<li><strong>Rectangle</strong> – A great tiling window manager for macOS. Keeps my windows arranged nicely. Code editor to the left, terminal to the right, all evenly spaced.</li>
<li><strong>Scroll Reverser</strong> – Makes switching between trackpad (natural scrolling) and trackball (non-natural scrolling) a breeze.</li>
<li><strong>Reflex</strong> - macOS sometimes hijacks the media buttons, this little app prevents that.</li>
<li><strong>Terraform</strong> – I use Terraform to manage all my cloud infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Orbstack</strong> - A great replacement for Docker Desktop that also allows me to spin up a quick VM from time to time.</li>
<li><strong>Tailscale</strong> – I use Tailscale to connect to my home network, sometimes with my Apple TV as the exit node which sounds weird but is awesome.</li>
</ul>
